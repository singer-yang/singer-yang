### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Ms/PhD student in [Computational Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). 

Education:
- MS in Computer Science, KAUST.
- BS in Physics (major) and Computer Science (minor), USTC.

Research:
- Deep learning for optical design
- Computational camera
- Optics-aware computational photography

We developed an awesome differentiable ray tracer [**DeepLens**](https://github.com/singer-yang/DeepLens) for optical design and photorealistic rendering, check the code! Iâ€™m open to discussion and collaboration, feel free to reach out! I also like basketball, water and outdoor sports, and photography.
