### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**News**: I will attend Siggraph 2022 in Vancouver, let's talk if you are also there!

I am currently a PhD student in [VCC Computational Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(KAUST) CEMSE, advised by [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Prior to this, I got BS degree in Physics(major) and Computer Science(minor) at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).

You can find my [homepaer](https://singer-yang.github.io/), and [lab profile](https://vccimaging.org/People/xingeyang/). My research interests lie on [**co-design of optics and image processing**]. We created a differentiable renderer(DeepLens) for general and direct optics and neural networks co-design, my current project is based on this. Iâ€™m open to collaborators on my projects, feel free to reach out! 

I am also interested in [quantitative trading/basketball/running/traveling/photography]. Let's talk if you have the same hobbies!
