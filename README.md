### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in [Computational Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). 

Education:
- 2022 - now, PhD in Computer Science, KAUST.

- 2016 - 2020, BS in Physics (major) and Computer Science (minor), USTC.

Research:
- Deep learning for optical design.
- Computational cameras.
- Optics-aware computational photography.

We developed an awesome differentiable ray tracer [**DeepLens**](https://github.com/singer-yang/DeepLens) for optical design and photorealistic rendering, check the code! Iâ€™m open to discussion and collaboration, feel free to reach out! I also like basketball, water and outdoor sports, and photography.
