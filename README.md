### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a MS/PhD student in [VCC Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(KAUST) CEMSE, advised by [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/).

My research interests lie on **ray tracing based differentiable lens design**, **differentiable rendering** and **End2End optimization**. I waste my spare time on photography, basketball and travelling.

Prior to this, I got BS degree in Physics and Computer Science(minor) at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).
