### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am now at Meta Reality Lab (Redmond, WA) for an internship. We can talk in person if you happen to visit.

I am a PhD student in [VCC Computational Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Prior to this, I got BS degree in Physics (major) and Computer Science (minor) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). More details on my [homepage](https://singer-yang.github.io/), and [lab profile](https://vccimaging.org/People/xingeyang/).

My research interests lie on **co-design of optics and image processing** and **differentiable imaging process simulation**, and their applications in 3D tasks. We created an awesome differentiable ray tracer **DeepLens** for general end-to-end optical design. Iâ€™m open to discussion and collaboration, feel free to reach out if you are interested! I am also interested in [quantitative trading/basketball/running/traveling/photography].
