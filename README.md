### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in [VCC Computational Imaging group](https://vccimaging.org/) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Prior to this, I got BS degree in Physics (major) and Computer Science (minor) at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). More details on my [homepage](https://singer-yang.github.io/), and [lab profile](https://vccimaging.org/People/xingeyang/).

My research interests lie in **differentiable optical simulation**, **end-to-end optics and network co-design**, and **computational imaging algorithms**. We developed an awesome differentiable ray tracer **DeepLens** for general end-to-end optical design. Iâ€™m open to discussion and collaboration, feel free to reach out if you are interested! I am also interested in [basketball/running/traveling/photography].
